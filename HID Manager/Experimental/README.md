# HID Controller v2

**High-performance USB HID bridge designed for 200+ simultaneous devices**  
*Fixed O(1) thread pool • Single-writer-per-device guarantee • Cross-platform*

---

## ✈️ Overview

HID Controller v2 is a complete architectural redesign optimized for large-scale cockpit builds. Unlike the original thread-per-device approach, v2 uses a **fixed thread pool** that maintains constant resource usage regardless of device count.

- **12 threads total** — whether you have 1 device or 200
- **No serial ports, no COM drivers** — pure USB HID
- **Network transparent** — panels can connect from any PC on your LAN
- **Professional curses UI** — real-time statistics with color-coded status

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **O(1) Thread Scaling** | Fixed 12-thread pool handles unlimited devices |
| **Single-Writer Guarantee** | Each device assigned to exactly one TX worker — no HID races |
| **Trigger-Based Protocol** | INPUT reports signal when to read FEATURE data |
| **Bounded Queues** | Backpressure protection prevents memory exhaustion |
| **Snapshot Pattern** | Lock-free device iteration for high-frequency reads |
| **Per-Device Locks** | Cross-platform HID safety without global contention |
| **Exception-Safe Broadcast** | UDP dispatch never crashes, even under load |

## 🔧 Critical Protocol Detail: Trigger-Based Drain

The firmware uses a **trigger pattern** that the host must implement correctly:

1. **Firmware** queues commands in a ring buffer
2. **Firmware** sends an INPUT report as a "trigger" signal
3. **Host** receives INPUT report (non-blocking poll)
4. **Host** calls `get_feature_report()` to drain the buffer
5. **Host** continues draining until empty (all zeros)

```python
# CORRECT: Only read Feature Reports after receiving Input trigger
data = dev.read(64, timeout_ms=0)  # Non-blocking
if data:  # Trigger received!
    while True:
        resp = dev.get_feature_report(0, 65)
        if not any(resp[1:]):  # Empty = done
            break
        process_command(resp)
```

> ⚠️ **Never poll `get_feature_report()` without a trigger** — this wastes USB bandwidth and may cause timing issues.

## 🛡️ Thread Safety Design

### Single-Writer-Per-Device (TX Sharding)

```
Device Assignment at Handshake:
┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│ TxWorker-0       │     │ TxWorker-1       │
│ ├── Device-A     │     │ ├── Device-B     │
│ └── Device-C     │     │ └── Device-D     │
└──────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
         │                        │
         ▼                        ▼
   ONLY TxWorker-0          ONLY TxWorker-1
   writes to A,C            writes to B,D
```

**Why this matters:** HID handles are not thread-safe on all platforms. By assigning each device to exactly one TX worker at handshake time, we guarantee no two threads ever write to the same device.

### Per-Device Locks

Each `DeviceState` has its own lock protecting HID operations:

```python
with dev_state.lock:
    dev.write(report)      # TX
    # or
    dev.get_feature_report(...)  # RX
```

Network/UI operations happen **outside** the lock to prevent contention.

### DeviceRegistry Snapshot Pattern

```python
# FAST: Returns immutable snapshot (no lock held during iteration)
devices = registry.get_all()
for dev in devices:
    process(dev)
```

> **Note:** UDP multicast typically doesn't cross routers. For multi-subnet setups, use unicast or a multicast relay.

## 🆚 v1 vs v2 Comparison

| Aspect | v1 (Original) | v2 (Scalable) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Thread Model** | O(N) — one per device | O(1) — fixed pool of 12 |
| **Max Devices** | ~20-30 practical | 200+ tested |
| **TX Architecture** | Per-device queues | Sharded workers with broadcast |
| **Thread Safety** | Global locks | Per-device locks + sharding |
| **Memory** | Standard objects | `__slots__` for efficiency |
| **Registry** | List iteration | Snapshot pattern |
| **UI Options** | Console + Tkinter GUI | Console only (lightweight) |
| **Backpressure** | Limited | Bounded queues, graceful drop |

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### No devices detected

1. **Verify VID/PID** in `settings.ini` matches firmware
2. **Check USB CDC On Boot** = Disabled in Arduino IDE
3. **Linux permissions** — add udev rule or run with sudo
4. **Try different USB port** — avoid hubs initially

### Device stuck on HANDSHAKING

1. **Firmware mismatch** — ensure `USE_DCSBIOS_USB = 1` in Config.h
2. **Stale state** — unplug, wait 5 seconds, replug
3. **Check handshake protocol** — firmware must echo `DCSBIOS-HANDSHAKE`

### Commands not reaching DCS

1. **DCS-BIOS enabled** — verify UDP export is configured
2. **Firewall** — allow UDP 5010 (RX) and 7778 (TX)
3. **Data Source** — ensure IP appears in stats header
4. **Check logs** — look for "IN:" messages confirming receipt

### High CPU usage

- **Expected:** 2-5% total across all threads
- **If higher:** Check for USB hub issues, reduce polling rate

### "Another instance running" error

- Close existing instance or delete `hid_manager.lock`

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How many devices can this handle?**  
A: Tested with 200+ simulated devices. Real-world limit is your USB infrastructure (see main README for xHCI limitations).

**Q: Why no GUI mode?**  
A: v2 focuses on performance and server-friendly operation. The curses UI works over SSH and uses minimal resources.

**Q: Can I mix v1 and v2?**  
A: No — use one or the other. They use the same lock file and would conflict.

**Q: What's the latency?**  
A: Sub-millisecond for button presses. UDP frames dispatched within ~1ms of receipt.

**Q: Is the single-instance lock necessary?**  
A: Yes — multiple instances would fight over the same HID handles, causing data corruption.
